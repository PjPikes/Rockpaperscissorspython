# Rockpaperscissorspython
my iteration of rock paper scissors in python 

this is where I learned how to use the import random module and the random.choice() method in order
for the computer to pick between 3 options rock, paper, or scissors

to play the game run the .py file in your terminal and either type in rock paper or scissors when the game asks
